# Website SEO Footer More

Obfuscate additional links in footer :
 
- Our References
- Resellers
- Events
- Jobs
- ... and so on

Links are disabled by default and need to be enable individually through Customize website menu. To keep some of these links visible to search engines, either disable them or (much better) add them in related pages in a contextual manner : included in a paragraph of text with explanations ; it will be better for search engine analyze.

## Why do you need this module ?

Footer links are not the biggest SEO problem, but they have bad effect on page rank, as you should allways control what pages receive page rank from important pages. Purpose of obfuscated links is to not send "Page Rank Juice" to each page linked in footer. This is called Page Rank Sculpture. Links are not obfuscated to visitors, only to search engines (as long as they ignore Javascript forms). Note : the no-follow link attribute has no effect on page rank since 2016.
