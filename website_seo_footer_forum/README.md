# Website SEO Footer Forum

Obfuscate forum links in footer.

## Why do you need this module ?

Footer links are not the biggest SEO problem, but they have bad effect on page rank, as you should allways control what pages receive page rank from important pages. Purpose of obfuscated links is to not send "Page Rank Juice" to each page linked in footer. This is called Page Rank Sculpture. Links are not obfuscated to visitors, only to search engines (as long as they ignore Javascript forms).
